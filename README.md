## React TODO App
This is a simple TODO application built using React.js. It allows users to manage their tasks by creating, updating, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. The application utilizes the browser's local storage to persist tasks even after the page is refreshed or closed.

## Features
* Create: Users can add new tasks by entering the task description and pressing enter or clicking the "Add" button.

* Update: Tasks can be edited by clicking on the task description. Users can then modify the task and save the changes by pressing enter or clicking outside the input field.

* Delete: Users can remove tasks by clicking on the delete button next to each task.

* Mark as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to each task.

## Local Storage
The application uses the browser's local storage to store tasks locally. This means that tasks will persist even if the user closes or refreshes the page. When the user visits the page again, their tasks will be loaded from local storage, ensuring a seamless user experience.
